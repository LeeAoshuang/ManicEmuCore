# ManicEmuCore
This repository is a fork originating from [DeltaCore](https://github.com/rileytestut/DeltaCore.git). Initially created as an experimental repository for personal learning purposes, it underwent significant restructuring including:  

1. Comprehensive renaming of identifiers to align with my personal conventions  
2. Architectural adjustments to core logic  
3. Enhanced audio management subsystem  
4. Refined GameView implementation details  
5. Extended skin system with touch effects animation support  

These modifications were subsequently integrated into Manic EMU for production use.  

**Current State Considerations:**  
- The cumulative changes have resulted in substantial divergence from the upstream repository, rendering effective merging impractical  
- While acknowledging this as a suboptimal development practice, the technical debt has reached critical mass  
- Planned remediation: Codebase refactoring to restore upstream compatibility, enabling potential PR submission for developed features  

This transitional state will persist until architectural realignment with the original DeltaCore implementation is achieved.
